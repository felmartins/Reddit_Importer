WARNING - DUE TO API CHANGES THIS WHOLE PROJECT IS NOW DEPRECATED - KEPT HERE FOR MY ARCHIVAL PURPOSES

This was a reddit scraper created as part of a internal project. However given the API changes, this is no longer useful.
Only reason i'm making the repository public is to allow a small portfolio visualization. Code is very old and would likely benefit from new passes (I was still learning, be patient ;-D).
